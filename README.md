## Courses

### [cis-231](/cis-231) - Fundamentals of Computer Science I - *COMPLETED*
Presents the fundamentals of an engineering approach to software development.

### [cis-232-233](/cis-232-233) - Fundamentals of Computer Science II & III - *IN PROGRESS*
**II:** Continues fundamentals of computer programming with emphasis on the use of
abstract data types such as tables, stacks, queues, and lists. Uses procedural and
object oriented methods to develop software solutions. Presents classic algorithmic
techniques such as searching, sorting, and recursion.

**III:** Introduces advanced concepts including: theory, generic programming implementation,
applications, and analysis of associated algorithms including lists, stacks, queues, hash
tables, trees, and graphs. Recursion, iteration, searching, and sorting algorithms and analysis.

### [cis-240](/cis-240) - Micro Arch & Prog - *COMING SOON*
Presents basic microprocessor concepts including internal architecture, memory, addressing,
and control through the use of assembly language.

### [cis-241](/cis-241) - Discrete Structures - *IN PROGRESS*
Develops and analyzes structures of computer science: numbers, sets, relations, functions and trees. This course includes propositional and predicate logic, applications of predicate logic: preconditions, postconditions, invariants, guards; inductive proofs; applications to verification of algorithms; introduction to complexity of algorithms.
